# Logic Editor Array Fields Update

## Changes Made

Both **Exclude By Default** and **Custom Instructions** fields are now displayed as itemized lists instead of single textboxes.

### Features for ALL Array Fields (including exclude_by_default and custom_instructions):

1. **Individual Items Display**
   - Each item appears as a separate pill/badge
   - Clean visual presentation with proper spacing
   - Items wrap to new lines when needed

2. **Delete Individual Items**
   - Each item has an '×' button to remove it
   - Click the × to instantly remove that specific item
   - No need to edit the entire list

3. **Add New Items**
   - Click "+ Add Item" button to add a new item
   - Enter the item name and press Enter or click Add
   - Items are automatically formatted (spaces to underscores for exclude_by_default)
   - Custom instructions keep their original formatting

4. **Visual Design**
   - Green-tinted pills for each item
   - Hover effects on delete buttons
   - "No items yet" placeholder when list is empty

## How It Works

### For exclude_by_default:
- Items like "small joint effusion" become "small_joint_effusion" 
- Each exclusion is individually removable
- Add new exclusions one at a time

### For custom_instructions:
- Instructions keep their full text formatting
- Each instruction is a separate item
- Can edit, add, or remove individual instructions

## Example:

Instead of:
```
[small_joint_effusion, trace_bursitis, mild_tendinosis]
```

You now see:
```
[small joint effusion] [×]  [trace bursitis] [×]  [mild tendinosis] [×]
[+ Add Item]
```

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Run Electron
npm run electron
```

The changes apply to:
- All `exclude_by_default` fields in impression sections
- All `custom_instructions` fields
- Any other array fields in the logic configuration
